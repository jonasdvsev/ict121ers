	 <p align="justify">The film that we watched was the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” an American animated superhero film based on Marvel Comics, released on December 2018, directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman and Screenplay by Phil Lord and Rothman. The stars of the film are Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Velez, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn, Nicolas Cage, and Liev Schreiber.  This film was the first animated film in Spider-Man franchise and set in Multiverse called the spider-verse. I used to think that American animation is unrealistic and boring so I think watching this animated film will be a waste of time but after giving it a shot it changed my mind, the film is good it was worth it watching.</p>
